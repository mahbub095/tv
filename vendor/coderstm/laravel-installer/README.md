## Routes

* `/install`
* `/update`

## Usage

* **Install Routes Notes**
	* In order to install your application, go to the `/install` route and follow the instructions.
	* Once the installation has ran the empty file `.installed` will be placed into the `/storage` directory. If this file is present the route `/install` will abort to the 404 page.

* **Update Route Notes**
	* In order to update your application, go to the `/update` route and follow the instructions.
	* The `/update` routes countes how many migration files exist in the `/database/migrations` folder and compares that count against the migrations table. If the files count is greater then the `/update` route will render, otherwise, the page will abort to the 404 page.
